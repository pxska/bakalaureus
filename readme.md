This repositorium was created to manage the files used in Kristjan Poska's bachelor's thesis.

The project "Possibilities of automatic analysis of historical texts by the example of 19th-century Estonian communal court minutes" is funded by the national programme "Estonian Language and Culture in the Digital Age 2019-2027".
